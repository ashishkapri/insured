    <h3>What we do?</h3>
    <p>
      Agencies and their staff often do not have technology tools that are
      simple and intuitive to manage their client and prospect relationships.
      From marketing and relationship-building to the sales process to account
      nurturing and retention a need existed for an all-in-one tool for Sales,
      Engagement, Analytics, and Mobility. InsuredMine fills that need.
